			<p>My name is Aaron and I am a self-taught web developer. Ever since I was a child, I've been fascinated by computers and as a result of this captivation I've endeavoured to learn about the various facets of modern front-end web development. Skills I have managed to acquire range from simple HTML and CSS, to more in-depth processes like JavaScript, jQuery, SCSS, Bootstrap, and SVG design and animations. </p>
			<p>Every day I push myself to take on a new challenge, learn a new skill, or improve the skills I currently have. Due to not having completed a formal education in web development or design, I have learnt my skills through various channels such as books, online courses and other miscellaneous resources. </p>
			<ul>Languages and Frameworks </ul>
				<li>HTML5</li>
				<li>CSS3</li>
				<li>Bootstrap 4</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>JQuery</li>
				<li>ExpressJS</li>
				<li>NodeJS</li>
			<ul>Programs and Utilities</ul>
				<li>Editors and IDEs (SublimeText, VSCode, VIM)</li>
				<li>Version Control(GitHub, BitBucket)</li>
				<li>Terminal Emulators(Bash, Zsh)</li>
			<ul>Soft Skills</ul>
				<li>Ability to work independently</li>
				<li>Familiar with using design documentation</li>
				<li>Quick to pick up new languages and design concepts</li>
			<p>I am fortunate to have already had the opportunity to work with small businesses, friends, and family to seek new projects and challenges to learn web design from a practical and realistic standpoint, however, I am now reaching a point where I feel I would truly benefit from a junior developer position in which I can learn from senior developers, expand my knowledge and get real world experience in web development.</p>
